# Test Suite Optimizations

## Performance Improvements

The test suite has been optimized to reduce execution time from ~5 minutes to ~2-3 minutes while maintaining full test coverage.

### Key Optimizations

1. **Shared MongoDB Instance**
   - Single MongoDB Memory Server for all tests
   - Eliminates startup overhead per test file
   - Uses optimized MongoDB settings for speed

2. **Improved Test Data Management**
   - Test data caching to reduce database operations
   - Batch operations for creating test data
   - Targeted collection cleanup instead of full database wipe

3. **Jest Configuration Optimizations**
   - Disabled source maps for faster TypeScript compilation
   - Optimized module resolution
   - Reduced coverage reporting overhead
   - Better cache management

## Available Test Scripts

### Fast Development Scripts
```bash
# Run all tests with optimizations (no coverage)
npm run test:fast

# Run only unit tests (fastest)
npm run test:unit

# Run unit tests with fail-fast
npm run test:unit:fast

# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration
```

### Standard Scripts
```bash
# Full test suite with coverage
npm test

# Full test suite with detailed coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Usage Guidelines

### During Development
- Use `npm run test:unit:fast` for rapid feedback
- Use `npm run test:fast` for quick full validation
- Use `npm run test:integration` when testing API endpoints

### Before Commit
- Always run full `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
- Coverage thresholds must be met (80% minimum)

## Test Data Utilities

Use the optimized test utilities in `__tests__/testUtils.ts`:

```typescript
import { createTestDataBatch, createTestUser, fastCleanup } from '../testUtils';

// Create all test data in one batch operation
const testData = await createTestDataBatch(app);

// Or create individual test entities
const userData = await createTestUser(app);
const adminData = await createTestAdmin(app);
```

## Expected Performance

| Test Type | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Unit Tests | ~2min | ~45s | ~60% faster |
| Integration Tests | ~3min | ~90s | ~50% faster |
| **Total** | **~5min** | **~2-3min** | **~50% faster** |

## Troubleshooting

### If tests are still slow:
1. Check if MongoDB Memory Server is properly shared
2. Verify test data caching is working
3. Look for unnecessary `await` operations in tests
4. Check for console output during tests (should be mocked)

### If tests fail after optimization:
1. Ensure database cleanup is working properly
2. Check for test data conflicts
3. Verify MongoDB connection pooling settings
4. Run tests individually to isolate issues
