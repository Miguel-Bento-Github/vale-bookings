## Cursor + Claude Sonnet 4 Implementation Strategy

**Project Structure for AI Efficiency:**

    └── component-specs.md
```

**AI-Driven Development Workflow:**
1. **Spec-First Development**: Write detailed component/API specs in `docs/` for Claude context
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Generate tests first, then implementation
3. **Incremental Building**: Implement one feature completely (with tests) before moving to next
4. **Context Management**: Keep related files open in Cursor for better AI understanding

**Testing Requirements per Phase:**

**Phase 1 (Backend Foundation):**
- Unit tests for all models and services (80%+ coverage)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database migration tests
- Authentication flow tests

**Phase 2 (Admin Features):**
- API endpoint tests for admin functions
- Authorization tests (role-based access)
- Input validation tests
- Basic frontend component tests

**Phase 3 (Customer App):**
- Component unit tests (Vue Test Utils)
- Store/state management tests
- Map integration tests (mocked)
- Booking flow integration tests

**Phase 4 (Advanced Features):**
- WebSocket connection tests
- Payment integration tests (with mocks)
- Notification system tests
- Performance tests

**Phase 5 (E2E & Mobile):**
- Complete user journey tests
- Cross-platform mobile tests
- API contract tests
- Load testing

**Cursor-Specific Setup:**
- Install Cursor extensions: ESLint, Prettier, Vue, Node.js debugger
- Configure `.cursorrules` file with project conventions
- Set up workspace with both backend/frontend folders
- Create template files for tests, components, and API routes
