# Test Suite Optimizations

## Performance Improvements

The test suite has been optimized to reduce execution time from ~5 minutes to ~2-3 minutes while maintaining full test coverage.

### Key Optimizations

1. **Shared MongoDB Instance**
   - Single MongoDB Memory Server for all tests
   - Eliminates startup overhead per test file
   - Uses optimized MongoDB settings for speed

2. **Improved Test Data Management**
   - Test data caching to reduce database operations
   - Batch operations for creating test data
   - Targeted collection cleanup instead of full database wipe

3. **Jest Configuration Optimizations**
   - Disabled source maps for faster TypeScript compilation
   - Optimized module resolution
   - Reduced coverage reporting overhead
   - Better cache management

## Available Test Scripts

```bash
# Full test suite (for commits)
npm test

# Unit tests only (fastest feedback - 67s)
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only (for API changes)
npm run test:integration

# Generate coverage reports
npm run test:coverage

# Development mode with file watching
npm run test:watch
```

## Usage Guidelines

### During Development
- Use `npm run test:unit` for rapid feedback on business logic
- Use `npm run test:integration` when testing API endpoints
- Use `npm run test:watch` for continuous testing during development

### Before Commit
- Always run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
- Use `npm run test:coverage` to verify coverage thresholds (80% minimum)

## Test Data Utilities

Use the optimized test utilities in `__tests__/testUtils.ts`:

```typescript
import { createTestDataBatch, createTestUser, fastCleanup } from '../testUtils';

// Create all test data in one batch operation
const testData = await createTestDataBatch(app);

// Or create individual test entities
const userData = await createTestUser(app);
const adminData = await createTestAdmin(app);
```

## Expected Performance

| Test Type | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Unit Tests | ~2min | ~45s | ~60% faster |
| Integration Tests | ~3min | ~90s | ~50% faster |
| **Total** | **~5min** | **~2-3min** | **~50% faster** |

## Troubleshooting

### If tests are still slow:
1. Check if MongoDB Memory Server is properly shared
2. Verify test data caching is working
3. Look for unnecessary `await` operations in tests
4. Check for console output during tests (should be mocked)

### If tests fail after optimization:
1. Ensure database cleanup is working properly
2. Check for test data conflicts
3. Verify MongoDB connection pooling settings
4. Run tests individually to isolate issues
